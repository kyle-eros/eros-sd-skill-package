## Integration Hooks

### Validation Phase (Immediate)
```python
if certificate.status == "REJECTED":
    add_learning(confidence="HIGH", source="validation", 
                 violation=certificate.violations, pattern=context)
if certificate.quality_score >= 85:
    add_learning(confidence="MEDIUM", source="validation",
                 quality=certificate.quality_score, pattern=decisions)
```

### Performance Feedback (7-14 days delayed)
```python
if rps > baseline * 1.15:
    add_learning(confidence="MEDIUM", source="performance",
                 impact=f"+{delta}% RPS", pattern=schedule_decisions)
```

### Promotion Rules
| LOW -> MEDIUM | Sample >= 10 AND 80% consistent |
| MEDIUM -> HIGH | User confirms OR 5+ validation successes |

---

## Agent Usage

- **schedule-generator**: Read HIGH/MEDIUM at start, apply corrections
- **schedule-validator**: Reference when scoring, generate learnings on reject
- **reflect command**: Extract session learnings, update stats, Git commit
